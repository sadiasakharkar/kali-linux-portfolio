Building a portfolio that emulates the power and stealth of Kali Linux — with an interactive, draggable terminal, real command execution, file creation capabilities, and a sleek desktop-style UI. All forged in the fires of React and Tailwind CSS.

_Encrypted for performance, designed for devs._

## React + Vite: The Base

This template offers a minimalist setup to execute React on Vite with blazing-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and top-tier ESLint rules.

Currently, two core plugins are integrated for optimized performance:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) — uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for efficient Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) — powered by [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for ultra-fast Fast Refresh.

### Expanding the Firewall
To ramp up your game, consider integrating TypeScript and activating type-aware lint rules for robust security. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for full encryption on your code and include [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) for extra protection in your dev environment.
